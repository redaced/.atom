# LiveReload for Atom

An [Atom](https://atom.io/) package enables you to control built-in [LiveReload](http://livereload.com/) server.
> LiveReload monitors changes in the file system. As soon as you save a file, it is preprocessed as needed, and the browser is refreshed.
>
> Even cooler, when you change a CSS file or an image, the browser is updated instantly without reloading the page.
>
> *from LiveReload official site*

## Usage
1. Select main menu `Packages > LiveReload > Toggle Server` to turn the server on. Or press `Ctrl+Shift+R`.
2. When the server started successfully, `LiveReload: PORT_NUMBER` text appears in the status bar(see the bottom right panel in the following screenshot).
