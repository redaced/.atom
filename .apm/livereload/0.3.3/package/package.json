As soon as you save a file, it is preprocessed as needed, and the browser is refreshed.\n>\n> Even cooler, when you change a CSS file or an image, the browser is updated instantly without reloading the page.\n>\n> *from LiveReload official site*\n\n## Usage\n1. Select main menu `Packages > LiveReload > Toggle Server` to turn the server on. Or press `Ctrl+Shift+R`.\n2.
